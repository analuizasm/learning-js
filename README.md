A collection of simple javascript projects that I'm doing while I'm still learning to master the language. 

# [Javascript Trivia Game](https://github.com/analuizasm/learning-js/tree/master/Javascript%20Trivia%20Game)
This is my first Javascript project! It's a question and answer game made using the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/)! I took this idea by using the florinpop17's [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository. It was a really fun experience!
