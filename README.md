# learning-js :green_book:
A collection of simple javascript projects that I'm doing while I'm still learning to master the language. 

# [Javascript Trivia Game](https://github.com/analuizasm/learning-js/tree/master/Javascript%20Trivia%20Game) :space_invader:
This is my first Javascript project! It's a question and answer game made using the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/)! I took this idea by using the florinpop17's [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository. It was a really fun experience! 

# [Javascript Drum Kit](https://github.com/analuizasm/learning-js/tree/master/Javascript%20Drum%20Kit) :musical_note:
I've found this project on the [30 day Vanilla Javascript Codding Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos.
The first challenge consists of a page that plays a different drum sound according to the key you press. <br /> It was also a great experience to improve my CSS skills!<br />
